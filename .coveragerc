# This config file is used by coverage.py (and supposedly pytest-cov).

# The protip for generating a coverage report on idb-backend is to
# change into the top level of idb-backend and then run:
#
# $ coverage run --branch -m pytest
#
# which will use this config file to access the sources listed below.
#
# To view the coverage report, run:
#
# $ coverage report
