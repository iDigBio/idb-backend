# idb-backend

This is the collection of code that makes up the iDigBio server side.

## Installation

### System Dependencies

Currently this project only works in python2.7.

The following library packages will need to be installed to run the api (assuming
Ubuntu 14.04): `python2.7-dev libgeos-c1 libblas-dev liblapack-dev
libatlas-base-dev gfortran libgdal-dev`

For ingestion the following are also needed: `libfontconfig-dev libav-tools`

### Python Dependencies

Install all of the python dependencies, this will be very slow the
first time, after that pip caches help.

    pip install -r requirements.txt

For ingestion you will also need to run

    pip install -r idigbio_ingestion/requirements.txt

For testing you will also need to run

    pip install -r test-requirements.txt
