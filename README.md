This is the collection of code that makes up the iDigBio server side.

## Installation

### System Dependencies

Currently this project only works in python2.7.

The following library packages will need to be installed (assuming
Ubuntu 14.04): `python2.7-dev libgeos-c1 libblas-dev liblapack-dev
libatlas-base-dev gfortran libgdal-dev`

### Python Dependencies

Install all of the python dependencies, this will be very slow the
first time, after that pip caches help.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
